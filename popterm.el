;;; Commentary:
;;
;; popterm.el — a terminal toggler merging three established patterns:
;;
;;  * Centered child-frame popup  (seagle0128/init-shell.el)
;;  * Multi-backend, named instances  (justinlime/toggle-term.el)
;;  * Smart auto-cd, TRAMP-awareness, scope  (jixiuf/vterm-toggle.el)
;;
;; Display methods:
;;   posframe   — centered child frame (requires posframe.el)
;;   window     — bottom split window
;;   fullscreen — full-frame buffer switch
;;
;; Backends (auto-detected at runtime, no hard dependency):
;;   vterm / ghostel / eat / shell / eshell
;;
;; Quick start:
;;   (use-package popterm
;;     :bind (("C-`"  . popterm-toggle)
;;            ("C-~"  . popterm-toggle-cd)
;;            ([f9]   . popterm-window-toggle))
;;     :config
;;     (setq popterm-backend        'vterm
;;           popterm-display-method 'posframe
;;           popterm-scope          'project

checks `selected-frame' against a whitelist of frames that should NOT
trigger a hide:

  1. The popterm child frame itself.
  2. Its parent frame (the root/workspace frame).
  3. Any other child frame (has a non-nil `parent-frame' parameter),

Additionally, the minibuffer guard prevents hiding during standard
minibuffer completion regardless of completion style.

The `popterm--inhibit-hidehandler' guard prevents spurious hides during
the `popterm-posframe-focus-delay' window immediately after showing,
addressing the Wayland/pgtk async focus race.

Fixes posframe#155 and Centaur Emacs issue #482."
